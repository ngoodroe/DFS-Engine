My work on creating algorithmic solutions to playing Daily Fantasy Sports

## The Goal
To create an algorithmic solution to playing Fantasy sports and hopefully win more and not lose too much money.

## The Sites and The Games
There are different sites and games that I write for and they are not the most crossover between the two.

### FanDuel
The first one that I started playing has a system where you are trying to build a team with a certain budgetary limitation while maximizing output. The normal game I play is the 50/50 where the top half of scorers win.

### PrizePicks
The other is PrizePicks where you try to select if players will score higher and lower in a certain stat and create parlays of those.
